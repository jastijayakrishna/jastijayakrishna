Jaya Krishna Jasti
Cybersecurity & AI Governance | MSc Computer Science
I build security tools, research AI governance frameworks, and work across the full stack. My focus is on making AI systems accountable and making security operations smarter through automation.

What I Do
🛡️ Cybersecurity — Threat hunting, incident response, detection engineering, SIEM analysis (Splunk), MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and building security tooling for real-world attack patterns.
🔒 AI Governance & GRC — Implementing and researching compliance frameworks (ISO 42001, ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST CSF, NIST AI RMF) with a focus on AI risk management, privacy-first tooling, and automation.
💻 Software Development — Full-stack applications, CI/CD pipelines, database design, and cloud infrastructure on AWS.
