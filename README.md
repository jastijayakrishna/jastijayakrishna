👋 Konnichiwa, I’m Jaya Krishna Jasti (@jastijayakrishna)

🔐 I’m deeply interested in Cybersecurity, focusing on SOC analysis, threat detection, and incident response.

🧠 Currently learning and building in network security, Linux hardening, and cloud defense (AWS, Splunk, Wazuh, Sigma rules).

💻 Exploring how AI can automate detection, triage, and risk scoring in modern security operations.

💞️ Open to collaborating on open-source security tools, detection engineering projects, or research around offensive/defensive security.
